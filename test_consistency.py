    1. **Lower Temperature (0.1)** - Reduces randomness in LLM responses
    2. **Focused Sampling** - Using top_p=0.8 and top_k=40 for more consistent token selection
    3. **Deterministic Prompts** - Added explicit consistency instructions
    4. **Structured Context** - More organized input format for reproducible results
